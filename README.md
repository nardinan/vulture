# Project Vulture

Project Vulture is a 2007 game server for multi-player adventures.

The idea of PV is to create an easy-to-understand environment for GDR campaigns and adventures, playable remotely by using a simple (and pre-installed everywhere) Telnet client.

## Server interface

The interface is really clean and easy to understand. It allows "The Master" (also known as "The Designer" that is the person that creates the adventure and handles every event or NPC in the game) to control immediately the status of the connected players.
